# Instagram Reels Downloader Script in PHP and Python
Instagram Reels Downloader Scripts that allow you to download Instagram reels onto your computer/phone easily

# About the PHP version
Due to CORS policy, you cannot directly show Instagram images/video as embedded links but if you plan to download them locally and display them, that will work.

# About the Python version
This allows you to insert Instagram reel links and save the video file directly onto your local folder. I'll add a usage guide later.
